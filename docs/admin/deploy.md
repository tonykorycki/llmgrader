# Deploying the LLM Grader on Render 

Our next step is to launch the LLM grader to [Render](https://render.com/) using a GitHub repository and a persistent disk.
Render handles the build, environment, and hosting automatically, so deployment is simple and repeatable.

---

## 🚀 Overview

A Render deployment consists of:

- a **Web Service** running the Flask application  
- a **Persistent Disk** mounted at `/var/data`  
- environment variables for admin authentication and configuration  
- automatic redeploys on Git pushes  

The grader stores uploaded solution packages on the persistent disk, so course content survives restarts and redeploys.  Before starting you will need to create a Render account, by
linking your GitHub to the Render.

---

## 📁 1. Prepare Your Repository

Your GitHub repository should contain:

```
llmgrader/
    app.py
    requirements.txt
    llmgrader/
        routes/
        services/
        templates/
        static/
        ...
```

Make sure:

- `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies  
- `gunicorn` is listed (Render uses it to run the app)  
- the app exposes `app` at the top level (e.g., in `app.py`)  

Example `app.py` entry point:

```python
from llmgrader import create_app
app = create_app()
```

---

## 🧱 2. Create a Persistent Disk on Render

In the Render dashboard:

1. Go to **Disks**  
2. Click **New Disk**  
3. Name it something like `grader-data`  
4. Choose a size (1–2 GB is plenty)  
5. Set the mount path to:

```
/var/data
```

This directory will store:

- extracted solution packages  
- logs (if you choose to write any)  
- future assets such as images  

Render guarantees that `/var/data` persists across deploys.

---

## 🌐 3. Create the Web Service

1. Click **New → Web Service**  
2. Connect your GitHub repo  
3. Use these settings:

**Environment:**  
```
Python 3.x
```

**Build Command:**  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Start Command:**  
```
gunicorn app:app
```

**Instance Type:**  
- Start with **Starter** or **Basic**  
- Upgrade later if needed

**Persistent Disk:**  
- Attach the disk you created  
- Mount it at `/var/data`

---

## 🔐 4. Set Environment Variables

In the Render service settings, add:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `LLMGRADER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin login password |
| `PYTHON_VERSION` | Currently set to `3.12.3` |
| `SOLN_REPO_PATH` | /var/data/repo_parent |

These are required for:

- Basic Auth on the admin pages  
- Which python version to use.  I believe this can be changed.
- Determining where the solution package will reside

---

## 🔄 5. Deploy and Verify

Render will:

- clone your repo  
- install dependencies  
- start the app with Gunicorn  
- mount the persistent disk  

Once deployed, visit:

```
https://<your-app>.onrender.com/admin/upload
```

Log in using the admin credentials you set.

Upload a test solution package to verify:

- the disk is writable  
- the package extracts correctly  
- units load successfully  

---

## 🛠️ 6. Redeploying

Render redeploys automatically when you push to the main branch.  
You can also trigger a manual deploy from the dashboard.

Uploads and course content remain intact because they live on the persistent disk.

---

## 🧹 7. Cleaning or Resetting the Disk (Optional)

If you ever need to reset the grader:

- SSH into the instance (Render Shell)  
- Remove the contents of `/var/data/soln_repo`  
- Or delete and recreate the disk from the dashboard  

This does **not** affect your code deployment.

Next: Go to [uploading a solution package](./upload.md) for instructions on packaging and uploading units to the admin interface.
